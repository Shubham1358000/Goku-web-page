<h3> ANIME </h3>  

Anime is a Japanese animation style that is produced or influenced by it. It is the Japanese term for cartoon or animation where the Japanese use the word to describe all cartoons irrespective of the nation. However, outside Japan, anime denotes animation movies that come exclusively from Japan, distinguished by blazing graphics, energetic characters, and attractive themes such as sci-fi, romance, and supernatural forces. Therefore, consider this syllogism: all anime shows are cartoons, but not all cartoons are anime. 

What is anime?

The art style connected with anime is distinct and easily identifiable. Large eyes, untamed hair, lengthy arms and limbs, and other features are certainly known to you. This exaggerated design allows the characters to convey their emotions more freely, which is plentiful in anime.
